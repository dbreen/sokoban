Sokoban
=======

This project was a first attempt at learning the LÖVE_ framework and Lua. It was a ton of fun and this is a really great framework for making simple 2D games. The goal was to make a Sokoban clone, with a rainbow-sparkle-sunshine theme. As fun as it was, I think I'd go insane if I had to listen to any of the music again.

Because of the aforementioned constraint, I didn't bother to finish this game. I borrowed levels from a Sokoban level site, and because I didn't have all the game elements required, a lot of them are unsolveable. Sorry. Press spacebar to skip level. Press W to win the game.

To run, download and install LÖVE_ then download and run the .love file: http://danbreen.net/games/sokoban.love
